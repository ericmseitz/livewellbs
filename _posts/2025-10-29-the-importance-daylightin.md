title: "The Importance of Daylighting — A Simple Fix for Safer Streets"
date: 2025-11-02

In a community as walkable and lively as **Belmont Shore**, visibility at intersections can mean the difference between safety and tragedy. Yet across our neighborhood, cars and oversized SUVs routinely park right up to the corners of cross streets — blocking sight lines and forcing drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians to edge out dangerously into traffic.  

This is where **daylighting** comes in.

### What is Daylighting?

“Daylighting” means keeping a short stretch of curb — typically **20 feet from a crosswalk or intersection** — clear of parked cars.  
The open space gives everyone a clear line of sight:
- Drivers can see pedestrians entering a crosswalk sooner.  
- Cyclists are more visible to turning vehicles.  
- Pedestrians can see oncoming cars without stepping into the street.

Daylighting is a **proven safety measure** endorsed by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s *Safe System Approach*. Cities from San Francisco to New York are implementing it with simple paint and flexible bollards — often reducing crashes by double-digit percentages.

### The Problem in Belmont Shore

Despite clear state law (California Vehicle Code 22500), daylighting is almost entirely **unenforced** here.  
Many intersections on 2nd Street, Nieto Avenue, and around the residential grid have vehicles parked all the way up to the corner. Drivers turning left or right can’t see pedestrians until the last moment — and families crossing with strollers or bikes face unnecessary risk.

Daylighting doesn’t require expensive infrastructure — just paint, signage, and consistent enforcement.

### Why It Matters

- **Improved visibility** saves lives.  
- **Fewer collisions** mean safer streets for everyone — especially seniors, children, and cyclists.  
- **Better walkability** supports our small businesses by encouraging people to stroll and shop, not just drive through.  

Daylighting is the kind of low-cost, high-impact improvement that embodies what *Live Well Belmont Shore* stands for — practical solutions that put residents first.

### What We Can Do

- Advocate for **daylighting enforcement** at key intersections in Belmont Shore.  
- Encourage the City of Long Beach to adopt a **Neighborhood Safety Audit** focused on 2nd Street visibility.  
- Report illegal corner parking through the **Go Long Beach** app — even a few reports help establish a record of community concern.

Let’s reclaim our corners — literally.  
With just a few feet of clear curb, we can make Belmont Shore safer for everyone who walks, bikes, or drives here.  
That’s how we **live well**.
